# Description

PAMELA is a dataset of PZT measurements of impedance-based SHM with temperature fluctuations in healthy and damaged conditions. This experiment was conducted at GMSInt and SHM Lab UNESP/Ilha Solteira.

The experimental setup for measuring electromechanical impedance in a thermal chamber is presented below.

An aluminum beam with a dimension of  500 mm x 40 mm x 2 mm of length, width, and thickness, respectively, is utilized in the tests. A PZT buzzer from Murata (number 7BB-35-3) with a diameter of 25 mm and thickness of 0.23 mm, with a base plate of brass, is bonded to the surface of the beam, as seen in the setup. The beam is tested in a free-free condition with elastic straps inside a thermal chamber. 

The structural modification to simulate possible damages is a sheer mass add by a clip or cuts with different deep. Four conditions are described as represented by damage D1 (mass of 3g), D2 (mass of 4.1 g), D3 (cut in the beam of 3 mm detpth and 1 mm width), and D4 cut in the beam of 9 mm detpth and 1 mm width, as explained in the figure below.

The impedance signature is estimated accurately using a LabVIEW software with a National Instruments DAQ device, model USB-6211 data acquisition system with 16 bits and a sampling rate of 250 kHz. A chirp signal with  1 V peak-to-peak in the range of frequency from 0 to 125 kHz is applied. An electric circuit adequately conditions the voltage and current. All details about the instrumentation and identification of the impedance signals used here can be found in the reference papers listed below for attentive readers.

Six sets of measurements in different temperatures are performed in the baseline and damage conditions. These temperatures are 24ºC, 40ºC, 55ºC, 70ªC, 85ºC, and 100ºC, controlled in a thermal chamber used in the test campaign. The data files have two folders with undamaged and damaged states with the real and imaginary impedance signatures measured and previously estimated.
